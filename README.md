# Insights into COVID-19 Critical Trends through Bubble Maps and Chloropeth Maps


## Background
In light of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic that has since altered our daily lives, the Johns Hopkins University has been conscientiously updating their COVID19 data analyses to aid in the fight against COVID-19. As of April 26th, the U.S. has reached the stage where identifying coronavirus hospots, peaks, and epicenters is crucial. For some counties and states that have either not been too affected by the coronavirus, or have already peaked in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths, a reopening phase may be a potential consideration, and for other states like New York which still remain largely affected, a reopening phase may need to be delayed. In order to implement any policies, future guidelines, or steps, we need to better understand the location of active cases and the confirmed cases and death reports by county. The U.S. is dealing with lives here, and it is important that we fully analyze and understand coronavirus trends with the understand that these analyses can save lives.

## Business Question
How can we visualize and better understand the overall toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on US counties or county equivalents? How can we use coronavirus data trend analyses to better implement future policies on reopening?

Our business question here remains twofold, as our main purpose of analyzing coronavirus trends is to understand the toll that coronavirus has placed on U.S. counties. However, we are reaching the stage where a reopening can be a possibility, at least in certain counties, so through our interactive heat map and map of COVID-19 cases, we can also attempt to answer how we can go about implementing policies by state/county moving forward.

## Data Question
We will be using data from the following sources:

- [JHU CSSE COVID-19 Case Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports)
- [New York Times COVID-19 Data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv)
- [U.S. County Geospatial Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/geojson-counties-fips.json)
